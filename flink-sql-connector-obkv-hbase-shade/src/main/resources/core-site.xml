<!-- Hadoop core-site.xml override for shaded connector -->
<configuration>
  <!-- 
    Override Hadoop default groups mapping implementation
    Use ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping instead of JniBasedUnixGroupsMappingWithFallback
    To avoid class loading issues after shading
  -->

    <description>
      Class for user to group mapping (get groups for a given user) for ACL.
      The default implementation uses JNI which may cause issues when shaded.
      This override uses the shell-based implementation instead.
